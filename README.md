# Cardiovascular Disease Indicators Repo
This a repository containing instructional information and a public dataset for potential use by Cardiovascular experts and practitioners.
## Contents and Source
Included within this repository is a pythin notebook explaining how to develop a subset of Cardiovascular Risk data from a raw .csv file using Python3.
- In order to use this python notebook it will require the "Google Colab" software.

It will contain two different .csv files, found in the Data folder:

1. CVD.csv.xlsx contains factors that may contribute to the onset of cardiovascular disease ragnging across various ages and general health conditions
2. _80_plus_subset.csv contains data referencing the same risk factors but is specific to people in the 80+ age range.

## Purpose
As with many other diseases, medical professionals and researchers strive to discover what factors may play a part in the onset of these diseases. The data within the files of thi repository highlight some of the common factors of CVD and isolating them by age, general health or preexisting conditions could shine a light on what seems to have the most affect on the emergence of CVD.
## Visualization


Part of the subset, general health and preexisting heart diesease can be displayed like so:
